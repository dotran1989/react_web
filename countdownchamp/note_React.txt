_ State:
+ Component own state.
+ Global state for entire app.

_ Updating state:
+ You must never mutate or change state direct in memory -> bugs in application

Ex: 
this.state.deadline = 'November 5, 2018'
this.state.counter += 1

+ this.setState({...}) -> pass entirely new object with a key value pair

+ 'this.state' and 'this.setState(...)' is extend from Component.
